Tic Tac Triangle
1. The game is played with two players.
2. Players must alternate turns, with x going first and o going second.
3. Players take put pieces on a three by three board on their turn.
4. If a player arranges three tokens or more tokens in a combination, 
   they score as many points as tokens in that row.
5. Combinations can be constructed horizontally, vertically, diagonally.
5. X and O pieces can only be scored on once.
4. Once there are no moves remaining on a board, the player who scored 
   the least points on that board selects the position of the next 
   three by three board.
5. All boards for the game are player on a larger 2 dimensional grid, 
   each board must be placed in such a way that it borders the last 
   board on a horizontal or vertical axis, where are least one side 
   is touching an existing board.
5. If tied for points on the previous board (or no player is able to score),
   the next player to move selects the new board.
6. On a new board, any cells from all previous boards that would 
   form a 3 or greater combination if played by the player who is 
   responsible for creating the new board form a triangle.
7. A triangle symbol is a wildcard symbol for both players for the purpose
   of forming combinations.
8. Triangles can be scored on up to twice, but only once by each player
9. A combination can be constructed along two axes so long as three or more
   symbols are on one axis.
10. When three triangles appear on a newly created board in a row, the player
    who created the board doubles their current score. The triangles are 
    unplayable for creating another triple triangle. The triangles are still 
    playable for creating combinations. The new board is not played and the 
    creation of another board is yielded immediatly to the opposing player.
